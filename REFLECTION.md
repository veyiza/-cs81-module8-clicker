# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
The functionality of the cookie counter made it clear how JavaScript can directly change what’s on the page.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I chose the suggested milestone messages as they are very simple.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?
My milestone code was outside the click event so it never ran and gave me some issues.

## What personal twist did you add?
I added backround colors and named it "Pontiff cookie clicker" as a reference to another game I like to play.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
Games and apps that track active progress or rewards use this same kind of interaction.
